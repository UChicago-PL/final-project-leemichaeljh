Project proposal
My plan for the final project is to build a music composition program in Haskell.
The project will model musical elements like pitches, durations, and even 
harmonic progressions as algebraic data types. The project will then export the 
final result to a playable format (MIDI) so that we can listen to the piece.

Easy
I hope to define the basic Music data type, and use a library like HCodecs or 
Euterpea to convert the Music data into a standard MIDI file.
- https://hackage.haskell.org/package/HCodecs
- https://www.euterpea.com/

A sample data type to encode various musical elements would look something like
data Duration = Whole | Half | Quarter | Eighth | Sixteenth
data Pitch = C | Cs | D | Ds | E | F | Fs | G | Gs | A | As | backwards
type Octave = Int

data Event = Note Pitch Octave Duration
            | Rest Duration
type Melody = [Event]

I then hope to create some combinators like transpose to shift a melody by a
 given interval or retrograde to play a melody backwards.
Other possible functions include inversion and retrograde inversion

Medium
Once I can play music using the project, I would like to play multiple melodies 
at once to create vertical layering, as well as add harmonies. 
I also hope to add generators for chord  progressions and accompaniment patterns 
like arpeggios, broken chords, or alberti bass.
It would also be useful to have a generator for an infinite bass line
(see Chapter 9 of HSoM for self-similar music),

Challenge
If time permits, I hope to implement a Markov model with a database of well-known
melodies. This model will hopefully extend shorter musical motifs into longer 
coherent phrases, using the State monad like in Chapter 15 of the course textbook.
I will probably also look at Chapter 13 of HSoM for more details.
